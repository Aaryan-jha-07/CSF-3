# Personal Portfolio Website

A responsive personal portfolio website designed to showcase my skills, projects, and contact information. This project was developed as part of the "Computer Science Fundamentals & Career Pathways" course assignment to demonstrate proficiency in HTML, CSS, and version control using Git and GitHub.

## 🚀 Features

* **Modern UI:** Uses CSS variables for consistent theming (`--primary-gradient`, `--text-color`) and glassmorphism effects in the header.
* **Animations:** Custom keyframe animations for text pulsing (`vibrantPulse`) and image floating effects.
* **Sticky Navigation:** A navigation bar that stays at the top of the viewport for easy access.
* **Project Showcase:** A grid-based layout to display project cards with hover effects.
* **Contact Form:** A styled frontend interface for user inquiries.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
* *VS Code:** Primary code editor
* **HTML5:** Semantic structure of the webpage.
